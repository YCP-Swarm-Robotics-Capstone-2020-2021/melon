# melon
Object recognition software for Swarm Robotics robots  
This is named after the organ dolphins used for echolocation, the melon, since the robots being recognized are referred to as dolphins.

## Dependencies
- C++17
- [OpenCV4](https://opencv.org)
- [Asio](https://think-async.com/Asio/) (Non-Boost, head-only version)
- [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)
- [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)
    - It isn't listed on the homepage, but use `sudo apt install libspdlog-dev` to install with apt
- [Spinnaker SDK](https://www.flir.com/products/spinnaker-sdk/)
    - Download the full SDK package for your OS
    - Specify the location of Spinnaker's header files with the "SPINNAKER_INCLUDE_DIR" variable
      - i.e. "-DSPINNAKER_INCLUDE_DIR=C:\Dev\SpinnakerSdk\include"
      - i.e. "-DSPINNAKER_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/spinnaker"
      - i.e. "-DSPINNAKER_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/spinnaker/include"
    - Specify the location of Spinnaker's library files with the "SPINNAKER_LIB_DIR" variable
      - i.e. "-DSPINNAKER_LIB_DIR=C:\Dev\SpinnakerSdk\lib\vs2015"
      - i.e. "-DSPINNAKER_LIB_DIR=C:\Dev\SpinnakerSdk\lib64\vs2015"
      - i.e. "-DSPINNAKER_LIB_DIR=/usr/src/spinnaker/lib"
      - i.e. "-DSPINNAKER_LIB_DIR=/opt/spinnaker/lib"

## Notes
IDE code inspection for the `State` class will not work properly unless the project has been built since `state.pb.h` is generated by Google Protobuf during compilation. So make sure to build the project first after cloning and anytime the `.proto` file is updated to ensure proper code inspection
